## Welcome to Career Exploration!

SAAS is really lucky to have such bright and passionate members in the club. Our course is meant to introduce the core concepts needed to perform data analytics at a professional level. This guide is meant to inform you about how the club will work 

### Getting Set Up

Go to https://datahub.berkeley.edu/ to log into your datahub. Datahub is where you will do the most of your work. This way, you do not need to download anything locally. 

Log into your Berkeley email. This should look like when you log into your Calcentral. Congratulations, you have logged into your Datahub! For lecture notebooks we release, we highly recommend you do them in Datahub.

### Assignments

The most important step of working through the notebooks is getting the notebooks in the environment in the first place. To do so, simply upload the .zip file.

Once uploaded, you can extract the files from the notebook via the terminal. To open the terminal, go to the new tab and click on the terminal option.

Then, in the terminal, use the unzip command to unzip the .zip folder

```markdown
unzip Lecture1_Datahub.zip
```

Find the .ipynb files for the lecture by navigating into the uncompressed folder. Now, you are done! You are now officially ready to do the lecture assignments on Datahub.
